# odin-recipes
This is the project at the end of the HTML Foundations section of The Odin Project.

In this project, I will be putting into practice some fundamental HTML knowledge.
I will be setting up basic webpages and using headers, paragraphs, lists, links, 
and images to make a recipe website. 

I will also be practicing using git and GitHub while making this project. This will 
allow me to get comfortable using git and writing good commit messages.

## CSS Foundations
Website has been and will continue to be updated as I follow along with the CSS
Foundations section of The Odin Project.
